## General info

Second verions of [SCS_RPC](https://github.com/Tarasa24/SCS_RPC), this time written in C++ using offical [Telemetry SDK](https://modding.scssoft.com/wiki/Documentation/Engine/SDK/Telemetry) for interacting with game data, as well as latest [Discord Game SDK](https://discord.com/developers/docs/game-sdk/sdk-starter-guide) for connecting to RPC pipe. Compiled dlls for both 64 and 32 bit version can be found in the [Releases page](https://github.com/Tarasa24/SCS_RPC2/releases).

##### What's new?

- Thanks to direct integration with Telemetry SDK and some code optimizations, users will be able to enjoy better performance and frame-by-frame data updates.
- That also means SCS_RPC is now standalone plugin and **won't require manually starting external program anymore**. Just copy the files and play!
